""" 
A positive integer N is given. The goal is to find the highest power of 2 that divides N. 
In other words, we have to find the maximum K for which N modulo 2^K is 0.

For example, given integer N = 24 the answer is 3, because 2^3 = 8 is the highest power of 2 that divides N.

Write a function:

def solution(N)
that, given a positive integer N, returns the highest power of 2 that divides N.

For example, given integer N = 24, the function should return 3, as explained above.
